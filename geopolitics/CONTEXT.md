# Geopolitics Context Pack

## When to Load

- Export control analysis
- CHIPS Act coverage
- China semiconductor policy
- Taiwan risk assessment

## US Export Controls

### October 2022 Rules (Foundational)

| Restriction | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Advanced logic chips | China AI/HPC |
| EUV equipment | All China |
| Advanced DUV | Leading-edge fabs |
| US persons | Can't work for China semi |
| FDPR | Foreign-made items with US tech |

### October 2023 Updates

- Closed loopholes (H800, A800 workarounds)
- Added more Chinese entities to Entity List
- Expanded equipment restrictions

### 2024 Updates

- Additional DUV restrictions via ASML
- HBM controls
- Ongoing tightening

### Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Entity List** | Banned from US tech without license |
| **FDPR** | Foreign Direct Product Rule — extends US jurisdiction |
| **License** | Case-by-case approval (mostly denied for China AI) |
| **De minimis** | Threshold for US content triggering controls |

## CHIPS Act

### Funding Overview

| Program | Amount | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Manufacturing incentives | $39B | New fabs in US |
| R&D | $13B | NSTC, packaging |
| Workforce | $500M | Training |
| Tax credit | 25% ITC | Equipment investment |

### Major Awards

| Company | Amount | Project |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Intel | ~$8.5B | Ohio, Arizona fabs |
| TSMC | ~$6.6B | Arizona fabs |
| Samsung | ~$6.4B | Texas fab |
| Micron | ~$6.1B | NY, ID fabs |
| GlobalFoundries | ~$1.5B | NY, VT expansion |

### Guardrails

Recipients cannot:
- Expand leading-edge in China for 10 years
- Share technology with foreign entities of concern
- Buy back stock with CHIPS funds

## China Semiconductor Policy

### Goals

- **2025**: 70% self-sufficiency (will miss badly)
- **Reality**: ~20% self-sufficient, mostly mature nodes

### Big Fund

| Phase | Amount | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase I | $20B | Broad investment |
| Phase II | $30B | Equipment, materials |
| Phase III | $47B | Advanced manufacturing |

### Key Players

| Company | Segment | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| SMIC | Foundry | 7nm without EUV (low yield) |
| YMTC | NAND | Entity Listed, struggling |
| CXMT | DRAM | Ramping, behind |
| Huawei/HiSilicon | Design | Cut off from TSMC |

## Taiwan Risk

### Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Status quo | Base case | Continued tension |
| Blockade | Low-medium | Chip shortage, prices spike |
| Invasion | Low | Catastrophic disruption |

### Mitigation Efforts

- TSMC Arizona, Japan fabs
- Samsung Texas expansion
- Intel US/Europe push
- Inventory building by customers

### "Silicon Shield" Theory

Taiwan's semiconductor dominance deters invasion — but also makes it a target.

## EU Chips Act

| Program | Amount | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Total | €43B | Manufacturing, R&D |
| Public | €11B | Direct funding |
| Private | €32B | Leveraged investment |

Key projects: Intel Germany, TSMC Germany (potential), STMicro/GlobalFoundries France.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Entity List additions** | Escalation pace |
| **China equipment imports** | Stockpiling behavior |
| **CHIPS disbursements** | US fab progress |
| **Taiwan Strait transits** | Tension indicator |
