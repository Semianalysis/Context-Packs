# SemiAnalysis Terminology

## Semiconductor Basics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Fabless** | Designs chips, outsources manufacturing (NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm) |
| **IDM** | Integrated Device Manufacturer — designs + manufactures (Intel, Samsung, TI) |
| **Foundry** | Contract manufacturer (TSMC, GlobalFoundries, Samsung Foundry) |
| **OSAT** | Outsourced Assembly & Test (ASE, Amkor) |
| **Node** | Process technology generation (e.g., 5nm, 3nm) — smaller = denser |
| **Wafer** | Silicon disc (~300mm) on which chips are fabricated |
| **Die** | Individual chip cut from wafer |
| **Yield** | % of functional dies per wafer — critical cost driver |

## Memory

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **DRAM** | Dynamic RAM — volatile, used for system memory |
| **NAND** | Non-volatile flash storage (SSDs) |
| **HBM** | High Bandwidth Memory — stacked DRAM for AI/GPUs |
| **HBM3/HBM3E** | Latest HBM generations, 3E = higher capacity/bandwidth |
| **LPDDR** | Low Power DDR — mobile devices |

## AI/Compute

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **GPU** | Graphics Processing Unit — parallel compute |
| **TPU** | Tensor Processing Unit — Google's AI accelerator |
| **NPU** | Neural Processing Unit — on-device AI |
| **ASIC** | Application-Specific IC — custom chip for one purpose |
| **Inference** | Running trained AI model on new data |
| **Training** | Teaching AI model on dataset |
| **FLOPS** | Floating-point operations per second |
| **TDP** | Thermal Design Power — heat/power envelope |

## Packaging

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CoWoS** | Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate — TSMC's 2.5D packaging for HBM |
| **Chiplet** | Modular die connected via advanced packaging |
| **Interposer** | Silicon layer connecting multiple dies |
| **2.5D/3D** | Packaging with dies side-by-side (2.5D) or stacked (3D) |

## Acronyms

| Acronym | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **TAM** | Total Addressable Market |
| **SAM** | Serviceable Addressable Market |
| **ASP** | Average Selling Price |
| **BOM** | Bill of Materials |
| **NRE** | Non-Recurring Engineering (design costs) |
| **WFE** | Wafer Fab Equipment |
| **EUV** | Extreme Ultraviolet (lithography) |
| **CapEx** | Capital Expenditure |
| **COGS** | Cost of Goods Sold |
| **GM** | Gross Margin |
| **OpEx** | Operating Expenses |

## Financial/Reporting

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Book-to-Bill** | Orders ÷ Revenue — >1 means growing backlog |
| **Lead Time** | Order to delivery time — longer = supply constrained |
| **Channel Inventory** | Stock held by distributors |
| **Sell-in vs Sell-through** | To distributor vs to end customer |
| **GAAP vs Non-GAAP** | With vs without stock comp, one-time items |

## Commonly Confused

| Often Confused | Distinction |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Node vs Gate Length** | Node is marketing (5nm); actual gate length differs |
| **HBM vs GDDR** | HBM = stacked, wider bus, higher bandwidth; GDDR = traditional graphics memory |
| **Foundry vs Fab** | Foundry = company; Fab = physical factory |
| **Die vs Chip vs Package** | Die = silicon; Chip = common term; Package = die + substrate + connections |
| **FinFET vs GAA** | Transistor architectures — GAA (Gate-All-Around) succeeds FinFET at 3nm and below |
