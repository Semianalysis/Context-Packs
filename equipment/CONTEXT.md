## Market Structure

### WFE Market Share (2024)

| Company | Share | Specialty |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Applied Materials | ~25% | Deposition, etch, CMP |
| ASML | ~20% | Lithography (monopoly in EUV) |
| Tokyo Electron | ~15% | Coater/developer, etch |
| Lam Research | ~15% | Etch, deposition |
| KLA | ~8% | Inspection, metrology |
| Others | ~17% | Various |

### Equipment Categories

| Category | Purpose | Leaders |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Lithography | Pattern transfer | ASML |
| Deposition | Film deposition | Applied, Lam |
| Etch | Material removal | Lam, Applied, TEL |
| CMP | Planarization | Applied |

## ASML Deep Dive

### Product Stack

| System | Use Case | Price | Volume |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| EUV (NXE:3800) | Leading-edge | $200M+ | ~50/year |
| High-NA EUV | <2nm | $350M+ | Ramping |
| DUV immersion | Mature nodes | $50-80M | High |
| DUV dry | Legacy | $20-40M | Declining |

### EUV Monopoly

ASML is the only EUV supplier. Period.

- **Moat**: 20+ years of R&D, Zeiss optics partnership
- **Customers**: TSMC (~50%), Samsung (~20%), Intel (~15%), Memory (~15%)
- **Capacity constrained**: Can't make enough EUV tools

### High-NA EUV

Next generation for <2nm:
- 0.55 NA vs 0.33 NA (current)
- Tighter patterns, fewer multi-patterning steps
- First tools shipping 2024-2025

## Equipment Cycle Dynamics

### Leading Indicators

1. **Foundry capex guidance** — TSMC sets the tone
2. **Memory pricing** — Determines memory capex
3. **Equipment lead times** — 6-18 months
4. **Book-to-bill** — Orders vs revenue

### Cycle Phases

| Phase | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Early upcycle** | Orders accelerate, lead times extend |
| **Peak** | Backlog maxed, pricing strong |
| **Downturn** | Orders slow, cancellations |
| **Trough** | Inventory digestion, cost cuts |

## China Exposure

### Export Controls Impact

| Company | China Revenue (Pre) | Impact |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| ASML | ~15% | EUV banned, DUV restricted |
| Applied | ~25% | Some tools restricted |
| Lam | ~30% | Significant restrictions |
| KLA | ~25% | Some restrictions |

### Domestic China Equipment

- SMEE: Lithography (DUV, far behind)
- Naura: Etch, deposition
- AMEC: Etch
- Quality gap: 5-10 years behind leaders

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Book-to-bill** | Demand vs shipments |
| **Backlog** | Future revenue visibility |
| **Gross margin** | Pricing power, mix |
| **R&D/revenue** | Innovation investment |
| **China revenue %** | Geopolitical exposure |
