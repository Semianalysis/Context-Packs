# Energy & Power Terminology

## Grid & Markets

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **ISO/RTO** | Independent System Operator / Regional Transmission Organization — operates the grid and wholesale markets |
| **PJM** | Mid-Atlantic grid operator (PA, NJ, MD, VA, OH, etc.) — largest US ISO, hosts NoVA datacenter corridor |
| **ERCOT** | Electric Reliability Council of Texas — isolated grid, deregulated, fast interconnection |
| **CAISO** | California ISO — high renewables penetration, aggressive decarbonization |
| **MISO** | Midcontinent ISO — large wind/solar resource area |
| **SPP** | Southwest Power Pool — wind-rich, growing datacenter interest |
| **LMP** | Locational Marginal Price — wholesale electricity price at a specific grid node |
| **Basis risk** | Price difference between two grid locations — affects financial PPA value |
| **Curtailment** | Forced reduction of generation output due to grid constraints or oversupply |
| **Congestion** | Transmission bottleneck causing price separation between grid zones |
| **Load pocket** | Area with insufficient local generation, dependent on imports |

## Interconnection

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Interconnection queue** | Regulatory process to connect new load or generation to the grid |
| **System impact study** | Engineering analysis of grid effects from proposed interconnection |
| **Facilities study** | Design and cost estimate for required grid upgrades |
| **Network upgrade** | Transmission/distribution improvement triggered by interconnection request |
| **Large generator interconnection (LGIA)** | Agreement for generators >20 MW |
| **BYOG** | Bring Your Own Generation — onsite power not reliant on grid import |
| **Islanding** | Operating disconnected from the grid (requires special protection) |
| **Point of interconnection (POI)** | Where customer's system connects to the utility grid |

## Power Procurement

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PPA** | Power Purchase Agreement — long-term contract to buy electricity at fixed/indexed price |
| **VPPA / Financial PPA** | Virtual PPA — contract for differences settled financially, no physical delivery |
| **LCOE** | Levelized Cost of Energy — total lifecycle cost per MWh of a generation asset |
| **LCOS** | Levelized Cost of Storage — total lifecycle cost per MWh of an energy storage asset |
| **Capacity factor** | Actual generation output / nameplate maximum — measures reliability (nuclear ~93%, solar ~25%, wind ~35%) |
| **REC** | Renewable Energy Certificate — tradeable proof of 1 MWh renewable generation |
| **24/7 CFE** | 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy — hourly matching of clean generation to consumption |
| **Additionality** | Whether a procurement decision causes new clean energy to be built |
| **Merchant risk** | Exposure to wholesale market price fluctuations |
| **Tolling agreement** | Contract to pay for generation capacity, buyer provides fuel |

## Efficiency & Cooling

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PUE** | Power Usage Effectiveness — total facility power / IT load (1.0 = perfect, typical 1.1-1.4) |
| **WUE** | Water Usage Effectiveness — liters of water consumed / IT energy in kWh |
| **CUE** | Carbon Usage Effectiveness — kg CO2 emitted / IT energy in kWh |
| **ERE** | Energy Reuse Effectiveness — accounts for waste heat captured and reused |
| **UPS** | Uninterruptible Power Supply — battery backup between utility loss and generator start |
| **PDU** | Power Distribution Unit — distributes power within a rack or row |
| **CDU** | Coolant Distribution Unit — circulates liquid coolant in liquid-cooled systems |
| **CRAC/CRAH** | Computer Room Air Conditioner/Handler — traditional air cooling units |
| **DX (Direct Expansion)** | Refrigerant-based cooling without chilled water loop |
| **Wet-bulb temperature** | Air temperature accounting for humidity — determines evaporative cooling effectiveness |
| **Dry-bulb temperature** | Standard air temperature measurement |
| **Delta T** | Temperature difference between supply and return (air or liquid) |
| **Heat rejection** | Process of removing waste heat from the facility to the environment |
| **Free cooling** | Using outside air or water when ambient conditions allow, avoiding compressor energy |
| **Economizer hours** | Annual hours where free cooling is available at a given location |

## Electrical Infrastructure

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Switchgear** | Electrical equipment that controls, protects, and isolates circuits — major supply constraint |
| **Transformer** | Steps voltage up (transmission) or down (distribution) — 12-24 month lead times |
| **Busway** | Enclosed conductor system distributing power from transformer to PDUs |
| **N+1 / 2N redundancy** | One extra (N+1) or fully duplicated (2N) power path for reliability |
| **Tier III / Tier IV** | Uptime Institute datacenter reliability classifications |
| **SLA** | Service Level Agreement — contractual uptime guarantee (e.g., 99.999%) |
| **Demand charge** | Utility fee based on peak power draw, not total energy consumed |
