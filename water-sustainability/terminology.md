# Water & Sustainability Terminology

## Water Metrics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **WUE** | Water Usage Effectiveness — liters of water consumed per kWh of IT energy |
| **Withdrawal** | Total water taken from a source (river, aquifer, municipal supply) |
| **Consumption** | Water permanently removed from the local watershed (evaporated, incorporated) |
| **Discharge** | Water returned to the source, potentially at different temperature or quality |
| **Water stress** | Ratio of total water demand to available renewable supply in a region |
| **Water scarcity** | Physical lack of water to meet demand — absolute or economic |
| **Watershed** | Geographic area draining to a common water body |
| **Aquifer** | Underground layer of water-bearing rock or sediment |
| **Groundwater depletion** | Extraction rate exceeding natural recharge — leads to permanent loss |
| **Water rights** | Legal entitlement to use water from a specific source — varies by jurisdiction |
| **Beneficial use** | Legal concept: water rights require water to be used productively |

## Cooling Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Evaporative cooling** | Removes heat by evaporating water — most water-intensive method |
| **Cooling tower** | Structure that evaporates water to reject heat from a condenser loop |
| **Wet-bulb temperature** | Temperature at which air becomes saturated — limits evaporative cooling effectiveness |
| **Dry-bulb temperature** | Standard air temperature measurement — determines sensible cooling capacity |
| **Approach temperature** | Difference between cooling tower outlet water temp and wet-bulb — lower is more efficient |
| **Cycles of concentration** | How many times cooling tower water is recirculated before blowdown — higher = less water |
| **Blowdown** | Draining a portion of cooling tower water to control mineral concentration |
| **Makeup water** | Fresh water added to replace evaporated and blown-down water |
| **Drift** | Water droplets carried out of a cooling tower by air flow — small but regulated |
| **Dry cooler** | Rejects heat to air without evaporation — no water use, less efficient in hot climates |
| **Adiabatic cooling** | Hybrid approach using evaporative pre-cooling of air only when ambient temperature is high |
| **Once-through cooling** | Water passes through heat exchanger once and returns to source — high withdrawal, low consumption |
| **Recirculation** | Closed loop reusing the same water with a cooling tower to reject heat |
| **Free cooling** | Using cold ambient air or water directly for cooling without running compressors |
| **Economizer hours** | Annual hours a location can use free cooling based on climate |

## Carbon & Emissions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **GHG** | Greenhouse Gas — CO2, CH4, N2O, fluorinated gases |
| **CO2e** | CO2-equivalent — normalizes all GHGs to CO2 warming potential |
| **Scope 1** | Direct emissions from owned/controlled sources (diesel generators, refrigerant leaks) |
| **Scope 2** | Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, steam |
| **Scope 3** | All other value chain emissions (manufacturing, transport, end-of-life) |
| **Location-based (Scope 2)** | Uses grid average emissions factor for facility location |
| **Market-based (Scope 2)** | Uses contractual instruments (RECs, PPAs) to determine emissions factor |
| **Embodied carbon** | GHG emissions from manufacturing, transport, and construction of equipment |
| **Carbon intensity** | Emissions per unit of output (gCO2/kWh for electricity, kgCO2e/server for hardware) |
| **Carbon offset** | Purchased credit representing emissions reduction or removal elsewhere |
| **Carbon removal** | Physical extraction of CO2 from atmosphere (DAC, enhanced weathering, biochar) |
| **Net-zero** | Balancing residual emissions with equivalent removals |
| **Carbon negative** | Removing more CO2 than emitted — Microsoft's 2030 target |

## Renewable Energy

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PPA** | Power Purchase Agreement — long-term contract for renewable electricity |
| **REC** | Renewable Energy Certificate — tradeable proof of 1 MWh of renewable generation |
| **Bundled REC** | REC delivered with the associated physical energy — higher credibility |
| **Unbundled REC** | REC sold separately from the energy — lower additionality claim |
| **Additionality** | Whether a purchase causes new renewable capacity to be built |
| **24/7 CFE** | Carbon-Free Energy matched on an hourly basis to consumption |
| **Annual matching** | Procuring RECs equal to annual energy use — less rigorous than 24/7 |
| **Firm clean power** | Carbon-free generation available on demand (nuclear, geothermal, hydro + storage) |
| **Intermittent** | Generation that varies with weather (solar, wind) — requires storage or backup |
| **Curtailment** | Reducing renewable output when supply exceeds demand or grid capacity |

## Reporting Frameworks

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CDP** | Carbon Disclosure Project — annual environmental questionnaire scored A through F |
| **SBTi** | Science Based Targets initiative — validates corporate emissions reduction targets |
| **GHG Protocol** | Global standard for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions |
| **TCFD** | Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures — risk reporting framework |
| **ISSB** | International Sustainability Standards Board — IFRS sustainability disclosure standards |
| **RE100** | Corporate commitment to 100% renewable electricity |
| **Climate Pledge** | Amazon-led commitment to net-zero by 2040 |
| **ESG** | Environmental, Social, Governance — investor framework for non-financial performance |
| **Materiality** | Significance of a sustainability issue to business value and stakeholder decisions |
| **Double materiality** | Considering both financial impact on company and company's impact on society/environment |
